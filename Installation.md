# How to install StaTech Industry
There are several ways to download and install the mod, and the sections below do not detail every single one, but rather what I recommend.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to run the modpack, regardless of launcher choice
1. [StaTech Industry instance](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/statech-industry/files)
    * Download the latest version
2. [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
3. Minimum allocated RAM: 6GB, recommended RAM: 8GB. 
    * Just because you have 32 GB doesn't mean you should go allocating anything above 8GB, as this can cause severe impact on how the Java garbage collector operates. 
    * If you only have 8GB of RAM you may have issues playing this pack. You do not leave much overhead for your OS if you're allocating at least 6GB, which can cause issues and potential crashes. (Windows is a hungry beast and can use around 4-6GB of RAM while idling).

# Install through Curseforge App
Probably the most straight forward method of installing the pack. Requires the installation of the [Curseforge App](https://download.curseforge.com/)
1. Open the Curseforge App and select Minecraft as your game. Configure your settings and link your game account if needed.
2. At the top, use the search function to find "StaTech Industry", then click the "Install" button.
3. Launching your game through Curseforge will open the default Minecraft launcher. You may need setup some additional settings before you can launch the game.

# Install through Prism Launcher
This is my preferred method of installing modpacks, but not everyone likes it. You can download the [Prism Launcher from here](https://prismlauncher.org/)
1. Open the Prism Launcher and setup your java install location and link your account.
2. Once that's done, click "Add Instance" 
3. On the left, click the "CurseForge" tab
4. In the search bar, type "StaTech Industry" 
5. With the modpack selected, click the "OK" button to begin downloading.
6. When prompted about mods blocking external downloads, click the "Open Missing" button. This will open your browser and start the downloads automatically for those mods. If you configured your download folder to be different from the default user folder (C:/Users/Name/Downloads) then you can click "Add Download Folder" to set what folder the launcher will track. Once it finds all those mods and shows a checkmark and "Found" next to each in the list, you can click "OK" to continue.
7. Once it's done downloading, click "Edit" on the right to check all your settings and make sure you're ready to go.

# Additional Launch Options
If you're having trouble running the pack, you can try adding some extra launch options to your game. I recommend taking a look at [this repository](https://github.com/LeSoot/Minecraft-FPS-Boost-JVM-Arguments). These arguments can usually be added in your launchers settings.
